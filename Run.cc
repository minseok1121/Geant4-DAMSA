// Exercise 1 Step 3:
// Implement a Merge method.
// The meaning of this will become clear
// When Multi-threading is discussed.
// This method of a MASTER instance is called
// By all worker threads passing WORKER run as
// parameter. Get the energy from WORKER run and
// Accumulate in the MASTER
// Do not forget to forward the call to the base class
// method to accumulate the number of processed events!

    // Accumulate histogram data from localRun into the current run.
